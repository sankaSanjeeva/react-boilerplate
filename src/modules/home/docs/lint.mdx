# Code Quality

We use `ESLint`, `Prettier`, `Husky`, and `lint-staged` in our React application to maintain code quality and consistency:

* `ESLint` Identifies and fixes problems in JavaScript code.
* `Prettier` Automatically formats code for consistent style.
* `Husky` Runs scripts during Git lifecycle events, like pre-commit hooks.
* `lint-staged` Lints and formats only staged files before committing.

These tools help keep our codebase clean, consistent, and error-free. If you use VSCode, install the
[ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and
[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
VSCode extensions to help fix ESLint issues.
