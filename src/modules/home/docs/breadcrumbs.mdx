## Breadcrumbs

You can render `<Breadcrumbs/>` anywhere you want, probably in the root component. There is no configuration required. The only thing need to do is add handle with a crumb

```tsx
{
  path: 'create',
  element: <UserCreate />,
  handle: {
    crumb: () => <span>Create</span>,
  },
},
{
  path: ':userId',
  element: <UserView />,
  handle: {
    crumb: () => <span>Details</span>,
  },
},
...
```
