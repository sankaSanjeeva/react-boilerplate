## Unit Testing

We use Vitest for unit testing in our project to ensure code quality and reliability. Vitest offers several key features:

* `Unit Testing` Write and run unit tests to verify individual components and functions.
* `Test Coverage` Check test coverage to ensure all parts of the code are tested.
* `Vitest UI` View test results and coverage reports in the browser for a more interactive experience.

Vitest integrates seamlessly with Vite, making it a powerful and efficient tool for maintaining robust code. Also check [IDE Integrations](https://vitest.dev/guide/ide)
